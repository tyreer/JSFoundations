This is a collection of JavaScript applications from the JavaScript Foundations course at Hack University—the educational branch of Hack Oregon.

1_arguments.js contains a function that accepts any number of arguments, and console.logs anything but numbers when the function is called. It also returns an array of the square roots of any and all numbers that were passed in as arguments. Primarily, this was a way to practice using arguments—a special variable inherent to all JavaScript functions.This exercise uses the map() method to create a new array from any numbers passed into the accepter function while also applying the Math.sqrt() function to those numbers.

2_arrayCompare.js contains a function that determines whether given values are in a given array or not. The function takes in the array to test as it’s first parameter, and then any other parameters passed in are compared to see if they are in the array. This exercise practices passing various arguments into a function and accessing them through the special arguments variable.

3_dataStructures.js is an exercise in writing data structures. One for my simple online media routine and another that loosley mimics how the TriMet API is structured.
